# Needleman-Wunsch Sequence Alignment 

This Python script implements the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for sequence alignment. The Needleman-Wunsch algorithm is a dynamic programming method used to find the optimal alignment between two sequences, considering matches, mismatches, and gaps. This README provides an overview of the code, its usage, the scoring schema, and an example of how to run it.

## Introduction

The Needleman-Wunsch algorithm is a widely used method for comparing and aligning sequences. It assigns scores to different alignment options and finds the optimal alignment by maximizing the total alignment score. This script allows you to align two sequences and visualize the alignment with gap characters.

## Scoring Schema
The script uses a simple scoring schema for sequence alignment:
- Match: +1
- Mismatch: -1
- Gap: -2
You can adjust these values within the code to suit your specific alignment needs.

## Example
Suppose you have the following input sequences:
- Sequence 1: "ATCGT"
- Sequence 2: "TGGTG"
After running the script with these sequences and the default scoring schema, you will get the following alignment:
- "ATCGT-"
- "-TGGTG"
